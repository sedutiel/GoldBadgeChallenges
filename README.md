# GoldBadgeChallenges

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate and utilize skills learned over the process of the gold badge course. 

While the project was extremely challenging, I did my best to use a combination of notes, help from Eleven Fifty staff and general problem-solving skills. 

The three challenges I chose to complete were Green Plan, Menu & Greeting. 

My basic approach was outlining the objectives of each challenge and creating the outline in VS. From there, each project was broken down by objective and processed accordingly. 

The Menu challenge runs via the console. However, I was unable to get my other two challenges to run properly. 

# Completely Booked

# General Info

For the Blue Badge Group API Project, the goal was to build a .NET Framework API Web Application using n-tier architecture. Our group created ‘Completely Booked’ which is a book publishing web application. The basic function of our application is to search a database of books, authors and publishers. Our data tables include Author, Book, Review and Publisher. We also used Trello to collaborate on tickets and LucidChart to collaborate on our ERD.
